## How to Play

### Explore the School

The player controls a student character who roams different locations within a school:

- **School Yard** (starting location)
- **Hallway**
- **Classrooms**

Each location hides pieces of a puzzle and contains cybersecurity tasks to complete.

### Unlocking New Areas

The school yard is the default starting area. To gain access to the hallway and classrooms, the player must play mini-games.

### Mini-Games (Access Challenges)

When a player wants to enter a new area, they must first pass an access mini-game. These mini-games include:

| Mini-Game | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flappy Bird | Navigate a character through obstacles |
| Doodle Jump | Jump as high as possible without falling |
| Pac-Man | Collect pellets while avoiding ghosts |

Achieve the required score to unlock the next area.

### Cybersecurity Puzzles

The puzzle pieces are scattered across all locations. Each piece is tied to a cybersecurity task — such as identifying phishing attempts, setting strong passwords, recognizing safe websites, and more. Collect all puzzle pieces by completing all tasks to finish the game.

### Certificate

Once the player collects every puzzle piece and completes all cybersecurity tasks, they are awarded a completion certificate recognizing their cybersecurity knowledge.
